# BellyButton_Biodiversity

The purpose of this project is to create a dashboard that allows participants in a study of belly button bacterial cultures to view the results of their sample. Volunteers from the study can view their results by choosing their Test Subject ID number from the dropdown menu. This will display the subject's basic demographic information and visualizations of the following data:

- A bar chart of the top ten bacteria cultures found in the subject's navel.
- The subject's belly button washing frequency.
- A scatter plot that shows the full results of the bacteria cultures in the sample.

The dashboard may be viewed at: [https://jhilberdink.github.io/BellyButton_Biodiversity/](https://jhilberdink.github.io/BellyButton_Biodiversity/)
